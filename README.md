## General
This projetc is a about knowing and implementation of the sorting algorithm
with `C` language respecting BigO constraint:
* Implementation of at least four different sorting algorithm
* What is BigO notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an
algorithm.
* How to select the best sorthing algorithm for a given input
* What is stable sorting algorithm
